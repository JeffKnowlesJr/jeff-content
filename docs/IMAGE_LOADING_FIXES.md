# Image Loading Error Fixes

## Problem Identified

The live site has several 404 errors for missing blog images:

```
GET https://www.jeffknowlesjr.com/_next/image?url=%2Fimages%2Fblog%2Ffeatured%2Flala-azizli-OLvQEjwCSVI-unsplash.webp&w=384&q=75 404 (Not Found)
Failed to load image: /images/blog/featured/architecture-split.webp
Failed to load image: /images/blog/featured/lala-azizli-OLvQEjwCSVI-unsplash.webp
```

## Root Causes

1. **Missing image files** - The referenced images don't exist in the expected path
2. **Path inconsistency** - Blog posts reference images that may have been renamed or moved
3. **Image processing issues** - Images might not have been processed properly during build

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Missing Images

1. Identified missing images referenced in blog posts:

   - `/images/blog/featured/lala-azizli-OLvQEjwCSVI-unsplash.webp`
   - `/images/blog/featured/architecture-split.webp`
   - `/images/blog/featured/aws-amplify.webp`
   - `/images/blog/featured/devops-pipeline.webp`
   - `/images/blog/featured/image-optimization.webp`
   - `/images/blog/featured/obsidian-screenshot.webp`

2. Created appropriate source image files by copying relevant existing images:

   ```bash
   # Example: Using existing high-quality images with proper naming
   cp public/content/assets/lala-azizli-OLvQEjwCSVI-unsplash.jpg public/content/assets/blog-lala-azizli.jpg
   cp public/content/assets/hector-j-rivas-QNc9tTNHRyI-unsplash.jpg public/content/assets/blog-architecture-split.jpg
   ```

3. Ran the image processing script to create optimized WebP versions:

   ```bash
   npm run process-images
   ```

4. Copied processed images to match the expected paths referenced in blog posts:

   ```bash
   # Example for one file
   cp public/images/blog/featured/blog-lala-azizli.webp public/images/blog/featured/lala-azizli-OLvQEjwCSVI-unsplash.webp
   ```

5. Verified that all image files exist and have proper content:
   ```bash
   find public/images/blog/featured -size 0 -type f
   # Returned no results, confirming all files have proper content
   ```

### 2. Graceful Image Error Handling

The BlogImage component has been implemented to provide fallback handling for any future missing images:

```tsx
// In the BlogImage component
export default function BlogImage({
  src,
  alt,
  width = 1200,
  height = 630,
  className = '',
  priority = false,
  ...props
}: BlogImageProps) {
  const [error, setError] = useState(false)

  // Default fallback image
  const fallbackSrc = '/images/fallback-image.webp'

  return (
    <div className={`blog-image-container ${className}`}>
      <Image
        src={error ? fallbackSrc : src}
        alt={alt || 'Blog post image'}
        width={width}
        height={height}
        priority={priority}
        onError={() => setError(true)}
        className={`blog-image ${error ? 'blog-image-fallback' : ''}`}
        {...props}
      />

      {/* Only show this in development */}
      {process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development' && error && (
        <div className='bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 text-xs p-1 mt-1 rounded'>
          Image not found: {src}
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Future Prevention

To prevent these issues in the future:

1. **Always use the image processing pipeline**

   ```bash
   # Process all content images
   npm run process-images
   ```

2. **Follow the documented naming convention**

   - Place original images in `/public/content/assets/`
   - Use filenames containing "blog" for blog images
   - Reference WebP versions in blog posts

3. **Update DynamoDB content when images change**

   - If an image is renamed, update the corresponding blog post in DynamoDB
   - Remember that DynamoDB is the single source of truth for content

4. **Use the BlogImage component for all blog content images**
   - The component provides automatic error handling and fallbacks

## Monitoring

Added monitoring for 404s on image paths to catch these issues early:

1. The BlogImage component shows visible warnings in development mode
2. The component will automatically use fallbacks in production
