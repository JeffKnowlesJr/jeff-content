# Mouse Push Optimization

**Status**: âœ… CLOSED - Performance optimizations implemented and verified working

## Issue Description

The background animation component (`EnhancedBackgroundAnimation.tsx`) was experiencing performance issues when users moved their mouse across the screen. This caused the application to lock up or become unresponsive, especially on less powerful devices.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the mouse interaction code that:

1. Applied forces to all nodes within a 150px radius of the cursor
2. Accumulated these forces without any limiting mechanism
3. Ran on every animation frame without throttling

This created a performance bottleneck when many nodes were affected simultaneously, causing the browser to struggle with the calculations and rendering.

## Solution

Three key optimizations were implemented to resolve the issue:

### 1. Force Limiting and Node Selection

```typescript
// Attract nearby nodes with force limiting
const maxForce = 0.05 // Limit maximum force applied
const maxNodesAffected = 20 // Limit number of nodes affected per frame

// Sort nodes by distance to mouse
const sortedNodes = [...nodesRef.current]
  .map((node) => {
    const dx = mouseX - node.x
    const dy = mouseY - node.y
    return {
      node,
      distance: Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy)
    }
  })
  .filter((item) => item.distance < 150)
  .sort((a, b) => a.distance - b.distance)
  .slice(0, maxNodesAffected) // Only affect closest nodes

// Apply forces to limited number of nodes
for (const { node, distance } of sortedNodes) {
  const dx = mouseX - node.x
  const dy = mouseY - node.y

  // Calculate force with damping
  const force = Math.min((150 - distance) / 1500, maxForce)

  // Apply force with damping
  node.vx += dx * force
  node.vy += dy * force

  // Limit node velocity
  const maxSpeed = 2
  const currentSpeed = Math.sqrt(node.vx * node.vx + node.vy * node.vy)
  if (currentSpeed > maxSpeed) {
    node.vx = (node.vx / currentSpeed) * maxSpeed
    node.vy = (node.vy / currentSpeed) * maxSpeed
  }
}
```

### 2. Mouse Event Throttling

```typescript
// Throttle mouse movement updates
let lastMouseUpdate = 0
const mouseThrottleInterval = 16 // ~60fps

const handleMouseMove = (event: MouseEvent) => {
  const now = performance.now()
  if (now - lastMouseUpdate >= mouseThrottleInterval) {
    mousePosRef.current = { x: event.clientX, y: event.clientY }
    lastMouseUpdate = now
  }
}
```

### 3. Visibility Detection

```typescript
// Track visibility state
let isVisible = true

const handleVisibilityChange = () => {
  isVisible = document.visibilityState === 'visible'
}

document.addEventListener('visibilitychange', handleVisibilityChange)

// In animation loop
if (!canvas || !ctx || !isVisible) {
  // If not visible, request next frame but don't render
  animationFrameId = requestAnimationFrame(animate)
  return
}
```

## Benefits

These optimizations provide several benefits:

1. **Reduced CPU Usage**: By limiting the number of nodes affected and throttling updates
2. **Improved Responsiveness**: The application remains responsive even during mouse movement
3. **Better Battery Life**: Reduced processing when the tab is not visible
4. **Consistent Performance**: More predictable behavior across different devices

## Implementation Notes

- The `maxForce` value (0.05) can be adjusted based on performance requirements
- The `maxNodesAffected` value (20) can be increased for more visual impact or decreased for better performance
- The `mouseThrottleInterval` (16ms) corresponds to approximately 60fps

## Further Optimizations

If performance issues persist, consider:

1. Reducing the total number of nodes in the animation
2. Decreasing the interaction radius (currently 150px)
3. Adding a toggle to disable the animation entirely
4. Implementing a "low performance mode" that reduces visual effects
