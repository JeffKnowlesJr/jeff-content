# Development Log Documentation

## Overview

The Development Log (Dev Log) is a feature of the JKJR Portfolio & Blog website that documents the development progress, challenges, and solutions encountered during the website's creation. It serves as a technical blog that provides insights into the development process and can be useful for other developers working on similar projects.

## Structure

The Dev Log is implemented as a section within the Next.js App Router structure:

```
src/app/dev-log/
├── page.tsx              # Main Dev Log page that lists all entries
├── layout.tsx            # Layout for the Dev Log section
├── loading.tsx           # Loading state for the main page
├── not-found.tsx         # Not found page for the Dev Log section
└── [slug]/               # Dynamic route for individual Dev Log entries
    ├── page.tsx          # Individual Dev Log entry page
    └── loading.tsx       # Loading state for individual entries
```

## Data Structure

Each Dev Log entry has the following structure:

```typescript
interface DevLogEntry {
  id: string
  title: string
  date: string
  content: string // Markdown content
  tags: string[]
  slug: string
}
```

## Implementation Details

### Main Page (`page.tsx`)

The main page displays a list of all Dev Log entries, with each entry showing:

- Title
- Date
- Tags
- Summary
- Link to the full entry

### Individual Entry Page (`[slug]/page.tsx`)

The individual entry page displays the full content of a Dev Log entry, including:

- Title
- Date
- Tags
- Full content (rendered as Markdown using ReactMarkdown)
- Back to Dev Log link

The Markdown content is rendered using the `react-markdown` library with the following features:

- GitHub Flavored Markdown support via `remark-gfm`
- Custom styling for all Markdown elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, code blocks, etc.)
- Syntax highlighting for code blocks
- Responsive tables
- Proper handling of links (external links open in a new tab)
- Dark mode support

### Layout (`layout.tsx`)

The layout provides consistent styling and structure for the Dev Log section, including:

- Metadata for SEO
- Consistent padding and width
- Background color

### Loading States (`loading.tsx`)

Loading states provide a smooth user experience while the pages are being loaded, using:

- Skeleton loading with animation
- Placeholder content that matches the structure of the actual content

### Not Found Page (`not-found.tsx`)

The not found page displays a user-friendly message when a page is not found, including:

- Clear error message
- Link back to the main Dev Log page

## Usage

### Adding a New Dev Log Entry

To add a new Dev Log entry:

1. Add the entry data to the `getDevLogEntries` function in `src/app/dev-log/page.tsx`
2. Add the full content to the `getDevLogEntry` function in `src/app/dev-log/[slug]/page.tsx`
3. Ensure the slug is unique and matches between both functions

### Markdown Formatting

Dev Log entries use Markdown for content formatting. The following Markdown features are supported:

- Headings (h1, h2, h3, etc.)
- Paragraphs
- Lists (ordered and unordered)
- Code blocks with syntax highlighting
- Blockquotes
- Links
- Images
- Tables
- Bold and italic text

### Styling

The Dev Log uses Tailwind CSS for styling, with:

- Consistent color scheme matching the rest of the website
- Responsive design for different screen sizes
- Dark mode support
- Typography using the website's font system

## Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements for the Dev Log include:

- MDX support for more complex content
- Search functionality
- Tag filtering
- Pagination for large numbers of entries
- Integration with a CMS for easier content management
- Comments section for community engagement
