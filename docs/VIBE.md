# Vibe Coding: AI-Assisted Development Framework

This document outlines our approach to "vibe coding" - the AI-dependent programming technique where developers describe problems to LLMs and guide AI-generated code rather than writing code manually.

## What is Vibe Coding?

Vibe coding is a development approach introduced by Andrej Karpathy in 2025, where developers:

- Describe problems in natural language to LLMs
- Guide, test, and refine AI-generated code
- Focus on outcomes over hand-writing every line
- Embrace a conversational approach to development

As Karpathy describes it: "It's not really coding - I just see things, say things, run things, and copy-paste things, and it mostly works."

## Vibe Coding Guidelines

### 1. Problem Description Principles

**Current Effectiveness: \_/5**

**Best Practices:**

- [ ] Use clear, concise natural language prompts
- [ ] Break complex problems into smaller chunks
- [ ] Include relevant context and constraints
- [ ] Specify language/framework preferences
- [ ] Reference existing patterns when available

**Improvement Actions:**

- Create a prompt template library for common tasks
- Practice iterative refinement of prompts
- Document successful prompt patterns for knowledge sharing
- Build a collection of domain-specific contexts to include

### 2. Code Evaluation & Refinement

**Current Effectiveness: \_/5**

**Best Practices:**

- [ ] Critically review all AI-generated code
- [ ] Test code thoroughly before implementation
- [ ] Understand the general approach, even if details are fuzzy
- [ ] Make targeted refinement requests rather than starting over
- [ ] Balance acceptance vs. understanding based on project criticality

**Improvement Actions:**

- Develop standard code review checklist for AI-generated code
- Create automated tests for common vulnerabilities
- Build understanding through iterative questioning
- Document areas where manual coding is still preferable

### 3. Integration with Existing Codebase

**Current Effectiveness: \_/5**

**Best Practices:**

- [ ] Ensure AI understands existing code patterns
- [ ] Maintain consistent style with established codebase
- [ ] Preserve naming conventions and architecture
- [ ] Address potential conflicts and edge cases
- [ ] Document AI-generated additions separately

**Improvement Actions:**

- Provide style guides and examples to AI
- Create integration validation tests
- Build a pattern library of successful integrations
- Maintain documentation of AI vs. human-written sections

### 4. AI-Human Collaboration

**Current Effectiveness: \_/5**

**Best Practices:**

- [ ] Use AI for boilerplate and repetitive tasks
- [ ] Maintain human oversight for critical logic
- [ ] Combine human creativity with AI efficiency
- [ ] Provide feedback to improve future interactions
- [ ] Know when to switch to manual coding

**Improvement Actions:**

- Define collaboration boundaries for different project types
- Create guidelines for when to use vibe coding vs. traditional coding
- Document successful collaboration patterns
- Build institutional knowledge around effective human-AI pairing

### 5. Ethical & Security Considerations

**Current Effectiveness: \_/5**

**Best Practices:**

- [ ] Verify code doesn't contain hidden vulnerabilities
- [ ] Ensure intellectual property rights are respected
- [ ] Validate AI doesn't hallucinate critical components
- [ ] Maintain appropriate level of understanding for project criticality
- [ ] Implement extra security reviews for sensitive applications

**Improvement Actions:**

- Create security scanning pipeline for AI-generated code
- Develop guidelines for appropriate use cases
- Build review standards based on application risk level
- Maintain transparency about AI-generated components

## Vibe Coding Project Types

| Project Type          | Vibe Coding Appropriateness | Required Human Oversight |
| --------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Prototypes & MVPs     | High                        | Moderate                 |
| Internal tools        | High                        | Moderate                 |
| Non-critical features | Medium                      | High                     |
| Core infrastructure   | Low                         | Very High                |
| Security-critical     | Very Low                    | Complete                 |

## Team Training Framework

**Current Progress: \_/5**

**Training Elements:**

- [ ] Effective prompt engineering
- [ ] AI capabilities and limitations
- [ ] Code review for AI-generated solutions
- [ ] Testing strategies for vibe coding
- [ ] When to use vs. when not to use

**Improvement Actions:**

- Create a vibe coding onboarding program
- Develop prompt templates library
- Build internal knowledge base of successful examples
- Establish peer review system specifically for vibe coding

## Measuring Success

Evaluate vibe coding effectiveness through:

- Development velocity (time to solution)
- Code quality metrics compared to manual coding
- Defect rates in AI vs. manually coded components
- Developer satisfaction and reduced cognitive load
- Proportion of time spent on creative vs. repetitive tasks

## Vibe Coding Maturity Model

**Current Level: \_/5**

1. **Experimental** - Individual developers trying AI coding tools
2. **Coordinated** - Team-level adoption with basic guidelines
3. **Integrated** - Formalized process with clear boundaries
4. **Optimized** - Refined workflows with measurable efficiency gains
5. **Transformative** - New development paradigm with AI as true partner

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions** (Next 1-2 weeks)

   - Evaluate current AI coding tool capabilities
   - Document successful vibe coding examples
   - Create initial prompt templates

2. **Short-term Goals** (Next month)

   - Develop basic training program
   - Establish review guidelines
   - Define project categories suitable for vibe coding

3. **Long-term Vision** (Next quarter)
   - Create comprehensive vibe coding playbook
   - Implement metrics to measure effectiveness
   - Build feedback loop for continuous improvement

Remember Karpathy's perspective: vibe coding is about embracing a new paradigm where human developers focus on guidance, validation, and refinement while leveraging AI to handle implementation details. The goal is not to replace human expertise but to amplify it through effective collaboration with AI tools.
