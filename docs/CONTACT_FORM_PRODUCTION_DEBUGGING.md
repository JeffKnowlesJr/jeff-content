# Contact Form Production Debugging

ðŸŸ¡ INVESTIGATING

## Current Status

Contact form is experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error in production, with the error message "Could not load credentials from any providers".

## Root Cause

1. **IAM Role Configuration**: The IAM role `jeff-content-amplify-role` needed expanded permissions and trust relationships:
   - Limited DynamoDB permissions (only PutItem)
   - Incomplete trust relationship for service principals

## Resolution Steps Taken

1. **Updated DynamoDB Policy**: Enhanced permissions to include:

   ```json
   {
     "Effect": "Allow",
     "Action": [
       "dynamodb:PutItem",
       "dynamodb:GetItem",
       "dynamodb:Query",
       "dynamodb:Scan",
       "dynamodb:UpdateItem",
       "dynamodb:DeleteItem"
     ],
     "Resource": "arn:aws:dynamodb:us-east-1:159370117840:table/jeff-dev-contact-forms"
   }
   ```

2. **Updated Trust Relationship**: Added necessary service principals:

   ```json
   {
     "Version": "2012-10-17",
     "Statement": [
       {
         "Effect": "Allow",
         "Principal": {
           "Service": ["amplify.amazonaws.com", "cloudfront.amazonaws.com"]
         },
         "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
       }
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Deployment**: Initiated new deployment to apply IAM changes (Job ID: 235)

## Verification Steps

1. Wait for deployment to complete
2. Test contact form submission with sample data:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Message: "This is a test submission"
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify item creation in DynamoDB table

## Next Steps

- Monitor deployment completion
- Test form submission
- Check CloudWatch logs if errors persist
- Update documentation with final resolution

## Lessons Learned

1. IAM roles require both appropriate permissions AND trust relationships
2. CloudFront service principal is needed alongside Amplify for proper credential chain
3. Comprehensive DynamoDB permissions are necessary for full functionality
