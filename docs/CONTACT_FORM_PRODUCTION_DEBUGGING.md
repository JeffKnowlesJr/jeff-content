# Contact Form Production Debugging

ðŸŸ¡ INVESTIGATING

## Current Status

Contact form is experiencing a 500 Internal Server Error in production, with the error message "Could not load credentials from any providers".

## Root Cause

1. **Inconsistent Implementation**: The application was trying to use both direct DynamoDB access and AppSync, causing credential issues:
   - API routes were attempting to use IAM roles for DynamoDB access
   - Other parts of the application were using AppSync
   - This mixed approach led to credential provider errors

## Resolution Steps Taken

1. **Standardized on AppSync**: Updated both API routes to use AppSync consistently:

   - Modified `/api/contact/submit` to use AppSync instead of direct DynamoDB access
   - Modified `/api/contact/test` to use AppSync instead of direct DynamoDB access
   - Removed DynamoDB client initialization code

2. **Environment Variables**: Ensured proper AppSync configuration:

   - `APPSYNC_API_URL`: The GraphQL API endpoint
   - `APPSYNC_API_KEY`: The API key for authentication

3. **Deployment**: Initiated new deployment to apply changes (Job ID: 235)

## Verification Steps

1. Wait for deployment to complete
2. Test contact form submission with sample data:
   - Name: "Test User"
   - Email: "test@example.com"
   - Message: "This is a test submission"
3. Check browser console for any errors
4. Verify item creation in DynamoDB table

## Next Steps

- Monitor deployment completion
- Test form submission
- Check CloudWatch logs if errors persist
- Update documentation with final resolution

## Lessons Learned

1. Consistency in API access patterns is crucial - mixing direct DynamoDB access with AppSync causes credential issues
2. AppSync provides a more secure and consistent way to access DynamoDB in serverless environments
3. Environment variables must be properly configured in the Amplify environment
