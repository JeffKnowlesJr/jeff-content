# Streamlining Build Processes with Prebuild Hooks and Static Generation

## The Challenge

Our portfolio website faced a complex challenge: integrating dynamic blog content with our CI/CD pipeline without slowing down builds. Initially, AWS Amplify builds were hanging for over 8 minutes because our build process was attempting to process markdown files, upload images to S3, and update DynamoDB records all during deployment.

## Our Integrated Solution

We streamlined our build processes by cleverly using prebuild hooks and static pre-processing. Here's our approach:

### 1. Leveraging Prebuild Hooks

We utilized the `prebuild` phase in our deployment pipeline to prepare static content before the main build:

```yaml
preBuild:
  commands:
    - npm run blog:ensure-json
    - npm run blog:json || echo "Warning: Failed to generate blog JSON, using fallback"
```

This prebuild process meant our blog content was ready before the React build started, eliminating processing delays.

### 2. Environment-Aware Processing

We implemented environment detection to use different approaches in development versus production:

```typescript
// package.json
"prebuild": "node -e \"process.env.SKIP_PREBUILD || require('child_process').execSync('npm run blog:json', {stdio: 'inherit'})\"",

// Amplify build
build:
  commands:
    - export SKIP_PREBUILD=true # Skip dynamic blog processing in Amplify
    - npm run build
```

This allowed developers to work normally in local environments while ensuring production builds remained optimized.

### 3. Failsafe Integration

To prevent build failures, we created a script that runs before any build to ensure the JSON file always exists:

```javascript
// ensure-blog-json.js
if (!fs.existsSync(OUTPUT_FILE)) {
  fs.writeFileSync(OUTPUT_FILE, JSON.stringify(emptyBlogData, null, 2), 'utf-8')
  console.log(`Created empty blog data file at: ${OUTPUT_FILE}`)
}
```

### 4. Progressive Enhancement Pattern

Our blog loading service implements a progressive enhancement pattern:

```typescript
export const loadBlogPosts = async (): Promise<BlogPost[]> => {
  try {
    // First strategy: Static JSON file (production-optimized)
    try {
      const response = await fetch('/data/blog-posts.json')
      if (response.ok) {
        const data = await response.json()
        return data.items
      }
    } catch (jsonError) {
      console.warn('⚠️ Falling back to next strategy')
    }

    // Second strategy: Direct imports (development-friendly)
    try {
      // Import code here...
    } catch (importError) {
      // Third strategy: API fallback if available
    }
  } catch (error) {
    return []
  }
}
```

## Seamless Workflow Integration

This approach created a seamless workflow between:

1. **Local Development**: Developers can run `npm run blog:json` to generate the static JSON or work directly with markdown files.

2. **CI Processes**: Our GitHub Actions workflow processes blog content independently:

   ```yaml
   on:
     push:
       paths:
         - 'content/blog/**' # Only triggers on blog content changes
   ```

3. **Deployment Pipeline**: Amplify builds use the prebuild hooks to ensure static content is ready.

## The Results

This integrated approach delivered multiple benefits:

- **Faster Builds**: Reduced build times from 8+ minutes to under 2 minutes
- **Development Flexibility**: Developers can work with direct files or generated content
- **Separation with Integration**: Content processing is separate but seamlessly integrated
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Multiple fallback strategies ensure reliability

## Lessons Learned

The key lesson was that effective CI/CD isn't just about separating concerns—it's about intelligently integrating them. By using prebuild hooks strategically, we maintained separation while creating a cohesive pipeline.

Our approach demonstrates how modern web development can balance the benefits of static generation with the flexibility of dynamic content by implementing the right hooks and fallbacks at each stage of the development and deployment process.
