# Modern Website Architecture: When to Split Your SPA for SEO

In the world of web development, we often face a fundamental tension: build a rich, interactive Single Page Application (SPA) or create a website that ranks well in search engines. The good news? You don't have to choose just one. In this article, I'll explain how mature architects approach this problem by strategically splitting web applications to get the best of both worlds.

## The SEO Challenge with SPAs

Single Page Applications built with React, Vue, or Angular offer exceptional user experiences with smooth transitions and interactive elements. However, they present significant challenges for search engine optimization:

1. **Render-blocking JavaScript**: Search engines must execute JavaScript to see your content
2. **Delayed content visibility**: Core content isn't present in the initial HTML
3. **Metadata limitations**: Dynamic metadata depends on JavaScript execution
4. **Crawl inefficiency**: Search engines allocate limited resources to JavaScript rendering

For many developers, the solution has been to implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG). But what if your application has both public-facing content that needs SEO and complex interactive features or admin sections?

## The Multi-Site Architecture Approach

Mature architects solve this problem by splitting the application into multiple specialized parts:

```
[Public Website - SSR/SSG] ← → [Application Portal - SPA]
            ↓                        ↓
      [Shared API Layer / Backend Services]
```

This architecture pattern offers several advantages:

1. **Optimized delivery**: Each part of the system uses the most appropriate rendering strategy
2. **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between different functional areas
3. **Independent scaling**: Different parts can scale according to their specific needs
4. **Targeted optimization**: Each part can be optimized for its specific use case

Let's explore how to implement this pattern effectively.

## Strategic Domain Splitting

The first step is identifying which parts of your application need SEO optimization and which benefit most from a rich SPA experience:

### SSR/SSG Candidates (SEO-Critical)

- Marketing pages
- Blog content
- Product listings
- Documentation
- Landing pages

### SPA Candidates

- Admin dashboards
- User accounts and profiles
- Interactive tools
- Complex form workflows
- Data-heavy visualizations

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Framework Selection

For the SSR/SSG portion, consider these options:

- **Next.js**: React-based framework with excellent SSR/SSG capabilities
- **Nuxt.js**: Vue equivalent of Next.js
- **Remix**: React framework focused on server-rendered experiences
- **Astro**: Multi-framework approach with excellent static site capabilities

For the SPA portion, continue using your preferred framework:

- **Create React App**: Simplified React application setup
- **Vite**: Modern build tool with fast development experience
- **Angular CLI**: For Angular applications

### 2. Shared Code Management

To maintain consistency across both applications:

```bash
# Option 1: Monorepo with workspace packages
/your-project
  /packages
    /shared-ui           # Shared components
    /shared-utils        # Utility functions
    /api-client          # API integration
    /marketing-site      # Next.js SSR site
    /admin-portal        # React SPA

# Option 2: Separate repositories with shared npm packages
@your-company/ui-components
@your-company/utils
@your-company/api-client
@your-company/marketing-site
@your-company/admin-portal
```

### 3. API and Data Sharing

Both applications need access to your backend services:

```typescript
// shared/api-client/src/index.ts
import { GraphQLClient } from 'graphql-request'

export const apiClient = new GraphQLClient(process.env.API_ENDPOINT, {
  headers: {
    // Authorization and other headers
  }
})

// Example query function
export async function fetchBlogPosts() {
  const query = `
    query GetBlogPosts {
      listBlogPosts(limit: 10) {
        items {
          id
          title
          slug
          excerpt
        }
      }
    }
  `

  return apiClient.request(query)
}
```
