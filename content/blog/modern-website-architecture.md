# Modern Website Architecture: When to Split Your SPA for SEO

In the world of web development, we often face a fundamental tension: build a rich, interactive Single Page Application (SPA) or create a website that ranks well in search engines. The good news? You don't have to choose just one. In this article, I'll explain how mature architects approach this problem by strategically splitting web applications to get the best of both worlds.

## The SEO Challenge with SPAs

Single Page Applications built with React, Vue, or Angular offer exceptional user experiences with smooth transitions and interactive elements. However, they present significant challenges for search engine optimization:

1. **Render-blocking JavaScript**: Search engines must execute JavaScript to see your content
2. **Delayed content visibility**: Core content isn't present in the initial HTML
3. **Metadata limitations**: Dynamic metadata depends on JavaScript execution
4. **Crawl inefficiency**: Search engines allocate limited resources to JavaScript rendering

For many developers, the solution has been to implement Server-Side Rendering (SSR) or Static Site Generation (SSG). But what if your application has both public-facing content that needs SEO and complex interactive features or admin sections?

## The Multi-Site Architecture Approach

Mature architects solve this problem by splitting the application into multiple specialized parts:

```
[Public Website - SSR/SSG] ← → [Application Portal - SPA]
            ↓                        ↓
      [Shared API Layer / Backend Services]
```

This architecture pattern offers several advantages:

1. **Optimized delivery**: Each part of the system uses the most appropriate rendering strategy
2. **Separation of concerns**: Clear boundaries between different functional areas
3. **Independent scaling**: Different parts can scale according to their specific needs
4. **Targeted optimization**: Each part can be optimized for its specific use case

Let's explore how to implement this pattern effectively.

## Strategic Domain Splitting

The first step is identifying which parts of your application need SEO optimization and which benefit most from a rich SPA experience:

### SSR/SSG Candidates (SEO-Critical)

- Marketing pages
- Blog content
- Product listings
- Documentation
- Landing pages

### SPA Candidates

- Admin dashboards
- User accounts and profiles
- Interactive tools
- Complex form workflows
- Data-heavy visualizations

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Framework Selection

For the SSR/SSG portion, consider these options:

- **Next.js**: React-based framework with excellent SSR/SSG capabilities
- **Nuxt.js**: Vue equivalent of Next.js
- **Remix**: React framework focused on server-rendered experiences
- **Astro**: Multi-framework approach with excellent static site capabilities

For the SPA portion, continue using your preferred framework:

- **Create React App**: Simplified React application setup
- **Vite**: Modern build tool with fast development experience
- **Angular CLI**: For Angular applications

### 2. Shared Code Management

To maintain consistency across both applications:

```bash
# Option 1: Monorepo with workspace packages
/your-project
  /packages
    /shared-ui           # Shared components
    /shared-utils        # Utility functions
    /api-client          # API integration
    /marketing-site      # Next.js SSR site
    /admin-portal        # React SPA

# Option 2: Separate repositories with shared npm packages
@your-company/ui-components
@your-company/utils
@your-company/api-client
@your-company/marketing-site
@your-company/admin-portal
```

### 3. API and Data Sharing

Both applications need access to your backend services:

```typescript
// shared/api-client/src/index.ts
import { GraphQLClient } from 'graphql-request'

export const apiClient = new GraphQLClient(process.env.API_ENDPOINT, {
  headers: {
    // Authorization and other headers
  }
})

// Example query function
export async function fetchBlogPosts() {
  const query = `
    query GetBlogPosts {
      listBlogPosts(limit: 10) {
        items {
          id
          title
          slug
          excerpt
        }
      }
    }
  `

  return apiClient.request(query)
}
```

### 4. Domain and Routing Strategy

You have several options for how to expose your split architecture to users:

#### Option 1: Subdomain Approach

- `www.yourcompany.com` → SSR Marketing/Blog Site
- `app.yourcompany.com` → SPA Application Portal

#### Option 2: Path-based Approach

- `yourcompany.com/*` → SSR Marketing/Blog Site
- `yourcompany.com/app/*` → SPA Application Portal

#### Option 3: Reverse Proxy Integration

Use a service like Cloudflare or AWS CloudFront to route requests appropriately:

```
User Request → CloudFront → Route based on path/domain → Appropriate application
```

## Case Study: Our Website Architecture

For our portfolio site, we chose a strategic split based on content type and user needs:

### SSR Site (Next.js):

- **Marketing pages** (`/`, `/overview`, `/contact`)
- **Blog system** (`/blog`, `/blog/:slug`)
- **Projects showcase** (`/projects`, `/projects/:slug`)
- **Resources page** (`/resources`)

### SPA (React + Vite):

- **Admin dashboard** (content management)
- **Interactive tools** (development tools for clients)
- **Portfolio experience** (`/port-inc`)
- **Development logs** (`/devlog`)

We connected these applications through:

1. Shared AWS AppSync GraphQL API
2. Common component library published as a private npm package
3. DynamoDB for content storage
4. Amazon Cognito for authentication

## Architecture Planning for Complex Ecosystems

When planning a multi-site architecture, mature architects employ several techniques:

### 1. C4 Model Documentation

The C4 model provides four levels of architectural detail:

- **Context**: System interactions with users and external systems
- **Container**: High-level technical components
- **Component**: Internal structure of containers
- **Code**: Implementation details

### 2. Domain-Driven Design Approach

- **Bounded Contexts**: Define clear domain boundaries
- **Ubiquitous Language**: Consistent terminology across teams
- **Context Mapping**: Define relationships between domains

### 3. Architectural Decision Records

Document key decisions with:

- Context description
- Decision details
- Consequences (positive and negative)

## Deployment Considerations

For AWS environments, consider this deployment approach:

```
[CloudFront Distribution]
      /     \
     /       \
[S3/Amplify]  [S3/Amplify]
(SSR Site)    (SPA Portal)
     \         /
      \       /
  [AppSync GraphQL API]
          |
     [DynamoDB Tables]
```

Key AWS services to consider:

- **Amplify**: For simplified deployment of both applications
- **S3 + CloudFront**: For static hosting with edge caching
- **AppSync**: For GraphQL API with real-time capabilities
- **DynamoDB**: For flexible data storage
- **Cognito**: For user authentication and authorization

## SEO Results and Performance Metrics

After implementing a split architecture, typical improvements include:

- **50-70% improvement** in Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)
- **95+ scores** in Lighthouse SEO metrics
- **Significantly improved** search engine ranking
- **Faster indexing** of new content
- **Maintained interactivity** for complex features

## When to Consider This Approach

This multi-site architecture is ideal when:

1. Your website serves both marketing/content and application functions
2. SEO is critical for business goals
3. You have complex interactive features
4. You want to optimize different parts of your site for different purposes
5. Your team can manage multiple repositories or a monorepo structure

## Conclusion

The all-or-nothing approach to web development—choosing either an SPA or an SSR site—is becoming outdated. Modern web architecture embraces a hybrid approach, using the right tool for each job. By strategically splitting your application, you can achieve both exceptional SEO performance and rich interactive experiences.

Remember that architecture decisions should always support business goals. If SEO is critical to your success, investing in a smart architectural split can deliver significant returns while maintaining the developer experience and user interface quality you've come to expect from modern web applications.
