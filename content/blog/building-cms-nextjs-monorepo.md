# Building a Modern CMS with a Next.js Monorepo Architecture

In today's content management landscape, the traditional CMS platforms often struggle to balance developer experience with content editor needs. For my latest project, I decided to take a modern approach by implementing a custom CMS using a monorepo architecture that combines the best of Next.js, React Router, and AWS cloud services.

## Why a Monorepo for a CMS?

A monorepo (single repository) architecture offers several advantages for content management systems:

- **Shared code**: Content models, validation logic, and UI components can be easily shared between the public site and admin interfaces
- **Simplified dependency management**: Dependencies are centralized and version conflicts are minimized
- **Atomic commits**: Changes across content models and their associated UI can be committed together
- **Easier refactoring**: Evolving the content model doesn't require complex cross-repository PRs

For a modern CMS, this approach allows for a cohesive ecosystem while clearly separating the concerns of content delivery and content management.

## Core Architecture Components

The CMS consists of several key components:

### Frontend Applications

- **Public Site**: A Next.js 15 application that serves as the delivery layer for content consumers
- **Admin SPA**: A React Router v6 + Vite single-page application for content authoring and management

### Backend Services

- **GraphQL API**: AWS AppSync providing a unified data layer with a resolver-based ORM pattern
- **Database**: DynamoDB for storing content metadata, user information, and relationship data
- **Authentication**: AWS Cognito for secure user management and role-based content permissions
- **Content Storage**: MDX for structured content with React components, using AWS S3 for media assets

### Developer Experience

One of my priorities was creating a smooth content authoring experience:

- Intuitive admin UI for content editors
- Preview capabilities for content before publishing
- Comprehensive content modeling tools
- Streamlined workflows for content creation and approval

## Infrastructure as Code

All AWS resources (AppSync, DynamoDB, Cognito, Amplify Hosting) are managed via Terraform, ensuring that the infrastructure is reproducible and version-controlled. This approach facilitates the creation of distinct environments for development, staging, and production.

## Content Management Strategy

I chose a hybrid approach to content management:

- **File-based content**: Structured content is written in MDX, which allows combining Markdown with React components
- **Database content**: Metadata, relationships, and user-generated content are stored in DynamoDB

This gives content authors the flexibility of a traditional CMS with the benefits of version-controlled content and developer-friendly workflows.

## Lessons Learned

Building this CMS architecture has taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **Content modeling first**: Define your content structures early to avoid painful migrations later
2. **Separate presentation from content**: Keep content pure and handle presentation at the component level
3. **Embrace GraphQL**: The flexibility of GraphQL is perfect for diverse content querying needs
4. **Infrastructure as code is essential**: The initial investment in Terraform configurations saves time when scaling

## What's Next?

As I continue to develop this CMS platform, I'm planning to:

- Add workflow and approval processes for content publication
- Implement more robust content versioning and rollback capabilities
- Build specialized editing experiences for different content types
- Develop analytics to track content performance
