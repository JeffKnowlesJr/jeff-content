## File Structure

- `content/`: Contains all blog posts and project descriptions in markdown format
- `public/`: Publicly accessible files like processed images and static assets
- `scripts/`: Utility scripts for image processing and other tasks
- `src/`: Source code for the website
  - `src/app/`: Next.js app router pages and layouts
  - `src/components/`: React components used across the site
  - `src/utils/`: Utility functions and helpers
  - `src/assets/`: Unprocessed files and source images before optimization

## Image Processing

Raw images should be placed in the `src/assets` directory. Use the scripts in the `scripts/` directory to process and optimize these images before they are used on the website:

- `scripts/process-images.js`: Processes and optimizes images from the assets directory
- `scripts/resize-blog-image.js`: Optimizes a blog image and creates a 16:9 aspect ratio version
- `scripts/convert-profile-image.js`: Converts HEIC images to JPG format and optimizes them

Always process images before using them on the website to ensure optimal performance.
